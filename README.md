# MATLAB-based-design-of-CMOS-two-stage-op-amp-

The code computes the transistor sizes of a two-stage opamp. The input parameters are the gain bandwidth product, slew rate, load capacitance, and supply voltage. The descriptions of the variables are listed in the following table.

|     Variable Name    |     Variable Description       |
|----------------------|--------------------------------|
|     SR               |     Slew Rate                  |
|     GB               |     Gain Bandwidth Product     |
|     CL               |     Load Capacitance           |
|     S                |     W/L                        |
|     Av               |     Voltage Gain               |
|     gm               |     Transconductance           |
|     ID               |     Drain Current              |
|     Vds              |     Drain to Source Voltage    |
